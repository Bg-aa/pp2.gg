#example of Comments in Python.  #ex1:
#This is commit    #Comments - starts with a "#" in Python

# ex2:
#  print("Comments are fun!")    # we can use comments after code

""" ex3:
#print("Hello, World!")
#print("Cheers, Mate!") """ # "#" - it's works only on one line

# ex4:
""" This is a multi-line comment
    which can span several lines
    in the program """

#ex5:
""" Python does not really have a syntax for multiline comments """ 
#Python ignores string literals that are not assigned to a variable
